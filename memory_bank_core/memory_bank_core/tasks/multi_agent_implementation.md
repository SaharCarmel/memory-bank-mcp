# Multi-Agent Memory Bank Builder Implementation

## Project Overview
Transform the memory bank builder from a single sequential agent to a multi-phase, multi-agent system with hierarchical memory banks and automated validation/fixing.

## Architecture Summary
```
Phase 1: Architecture Agent → architecture_manifest.md
Phase 2: Component Agents (concurrent) → component memory banks
Phase 3: Validation Agents (concurrent) → validation + auto-fix
```

## Phase 1: Architecture Agent Implementation

### Deliverables
- [x] Architecture Agent class implementation
- [x] Architecture manifest schema definition
- [x] Mermaid diagram generation
- [x] Component detection heuristics
- [x] Integration with existing job manager (via MultiAgentMemoryBankBuilder)

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create `ArchitectureAgent` class in `/memory_bank_core/agents/architecture_agent.py`
- [x] Define `architecture_manifest.md` schema
- [ ] Implement component detection logic:
  - [ ] Service boundary detection (service configuration files)
  - [ ] Frontend application detection (package.json patterns)
  - [ ] Shared library detection
  - [ ] Monolith layer detection
- [x] Create architecture diagram generator (Mermaid)
- [x] Implement breakdown depth heuristics
- [x] Add configuration options for analysis depth

### Testing Plan
1. **Unit Tests** (`test_architecture_agent.py`):
   - Test component detection on sample repos:
     - Microservices repo (10-20 services)
     - Monolithic repo (layered architecture)
     - Mixed architecture (frontend + backend + workers)
   - Validate manifest schema compliance
   - Test diagram generation

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test with real repositories:
     - Small project (< 5 components)
     - Medium project (5-15 components)
     - Large project (> 15 components)
   - Measure performance and accuracy

3. **Success Criteria**:
   - Correctly identifies all major components
   - Generates valid Mermaid diagrams
   - Produces parseable manifest for Phase 2
   - Clear component boundaries and relationships

### Test Repositories
- `test_repos/microservices_sample/` - 10 service e-commerce platform
- `test_repos/monolith_sample/` - Traditional MVC application
- `test_repos/mixed_arch_sample/` - React frontend + Python backend + Go workers

## Phase 2: Component Agent & Orchestration

### Deliverables
- [x] Component Agent class implementation
- [x] Orchestration Agent for parallel execution
- [x] Queue-based job distribution (via asyncio)
- [x] Component memory bank structure
- [x] Progress tracking and monitoring

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create `ComponentAgent` class in `/memory_bank_core/agents/component_agent.py`
- [x] Create `OrchestrationAgent` class in `/memory_bank_core/agents/orchestration_agent.py`
- [x] Implement parallel execution framework:
  - [x] Job queue with priority support (via asyncio.Semaphore)
  - [x] Resource management (max concurrent agents)
  - [x] Failure isolation and retry logic
- [x] Define component memory bank schema
- [x] Implement progress aggregation
- [x] Add component-specific prompt templates

### Testing Plan
1. **Unit Tests** (`test_component_agent.py`):
   - Test single component analysis
   - Validate memory bank file creation
   - Test error handling and recovery

2. **Parallel Execution Tests** (`test_orchestration.py`):
   - Test concurrent agent spawning
   - Test failure handling:
     - Single agent failure
     - Multiple agent failures
     - Component isolation (one failure doesn't affect others)
   - Validate job queue distribution
   - Test completion tracking

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Run full Phase 1 → Phase 2 pipeline
   - Test with architecture manifests from Phase 1
   - Validate all components get processed
   - Check parent-child relationships

4. **Success Criteria**:
   - All components from manifest get processed
   - Individual component failures don't crash system
   - Memory banks follow defined schema
   - Proper hierarchical structure maintained

## Phase 3: Validation & Auto-Fix Agents

### Deliverables
- [x] Validation Agent class with auto-fix capability
- [x] Validation report schema
- [x] Fix strategy implementation
- [x] Confidence scoring system
- [x] Final aggregation and reporting

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create `ValidationAgent` class in `/memory_bank_core/agents/validation_agent.py`
- [x] Create `ValidationOrchestrator` class for parallel validation
- [x] Implement validation checks:
  - [x] Completeness validation
  - [x] Accuracy validation (code verification)
  - [x] Consistency validation
  - [x] Cross-reference validation
- [x] Implement auto-fix strategies:
  - [x] Missing file generation
  - [x] Empty section population
  - [x] Inconsistency resolution
  - [x] Placeholder replacement
- [x] Create confidence scoring algorithm
- [x] Implement validation report generation
- [x] Add fix verification loop
- [x] Parallel validation with up to 10 concurrent validators

### Testing Plan
1. **Unit Tests** (`test_validation_agent.py`):
   - Test each validation type:
     - Completeness checks
     - Accuracy verification
     - Consistency validation
   - Test auto-fix strategies:
     - Fix missing files
     - Fix empty sections
     - Resolve contradictions

2. **Fix Quality Tests**:
   - Inject known issues into memory banks
   - Run validation + auto-fix
   - Verify fixes are correct
   - Test fix confidence scores

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Full pipeline: Architecture → Components → Validation
   - Test with intentionally flawed component outputs
   - Measure fix success rate
   - Validate final memory bank quality

4. **Success Criteria**:
   - Detects 95%+ of injected issues
   - Successfully fixes 80%+ of issues
   - No false positives in validation
   - Clear audit trail of fixes

### Validation Test Scenarios
1. **Missing Files**: Component agent fails to create required files
2. **Empty Sections**: Files created but sections empty
3. **Inaccurate Claims**: Documentation doesn't match code
4. **Inconsistencies**: Conflicting information between files
5. **Broken References**: Links to non-existent components

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Claude API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement request queuing and backoff
   
2. **Complex Dependency Graphs**
   - Mitigation: Cycle detection, maximum depth limits

3. **Agent Coordination Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Clear phase boundaries, simple communication patterns

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict phase boundaries, feature freeze per phase

2. **Testing Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test repos, automated testing

## Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- Validation agents will attempt auto-fix before reporting issues
- Concurrent agents run without strict limits (system dependent)
- Component threshold: architecture agent decides based on logical boundaries
- Validation happens after component completion, not during
- Focus on correctness over speed

### Open Questions
- [ ] How to handle cross-component validation?
- [ ] Should validation agents have write access to component agent files?
- [ ] Retry strategy for failed auto-fixes?
