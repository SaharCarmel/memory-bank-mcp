- **Preliminary Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Update**: Every week until resolved
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### 🏆 Security Disclosure Process

1. **Report received** → We acknowledge receipt
2. **Investigation** → We investigate and reproduce
3. **Assessment** → We assess impact and severity
4. **Fix development** → We develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated disclosure** → We notify you before public release
6. **Public disclosure** → We release fix and advisory

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Self-Hosted Deployments

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys or secrets
- **Network Security**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Updates**: Keep dependencies and Docker images updated
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity

### For GitHub Action Usage

- **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for API keys
- **Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege
- **Dependencies**: Pin action versions (e.g., `@v1.2.3` not `@main`)
- **Audit**: Regularly review action permissions

### For Developers

- **Dependency Scanning**: Use automated tools to scan dependencies
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review
- **Testing**: Include security testing in your workflow
- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like CodeQL, Semgrep

## 🔍 Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Sandbox Isolation**: Repository analysis runs in isolated environments
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limiting
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration defaults

### API Security

- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication for API access
- **CORS**: Properly configured CORS policies
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs sanitized before processing
- **Output Encoding**: All outputs properly encoded

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Repository Analysis

- MemBankBuilder analyzes repository contents using AI
- Ensure repositories don't contain sensitive information
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Review memory bank outputs before sharing

### Self-Hosted Deployments

- Secure your deployment environment
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Keep systems updated
- Monitor for unauthorized access

### GitHub Action

- Review repository contents before using the action
- Use repository secrets for sensitive configuration
- Monitor action logs for unusual activity
